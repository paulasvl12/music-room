  <h1> Hip Hop</h1>
  <p id="first">Hip hop music, also known as rap music, is a genre of popular music developed 
  in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the 
  Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s. Hip hop as both a musical genre and a 
  culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in
   New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At
    block parties DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables 
    and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, 
    alternating from one to the other and extending the "break". Hip hop's early 
    evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available
     and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed
    along with the breaks and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal style, was used 
    over the beats. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or 
    chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat. </p>
